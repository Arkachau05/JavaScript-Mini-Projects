## Concept Demonstrated

### DOM Manipulation and Event Handling

This project shows how to manipulate the DOM and handle events in JavaScript.

### Code Explanation

- The game board is represented as a grid of div elements.
- Event listeners are added to each cell to handle clicks.
- The game state is stored in an array, and the current player is tracked with a variable.
- When a cell is clicked, the game state is updated, and the cell's content is set to the current player's symbol.
- The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a message if a player wins or if there is a tie.
- The "Reset" button resets the game state and clears the board.

This project provides a simple and interactive way to learn JavaScript basics. Enjoy playing and coding!
